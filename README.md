# The-Coders
The aim of this project is to develop a healthcare system that generates recipes for common meals and identifies viable substitutes for allergens, making meal planning easier and more accessible to individuals with food allergies. The most common food allergens are milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, butter, wheat, and soy. Individuals with food allergies face significant challenges when it comes to meal planning, and often have to rely on processed and pre-packaged foods that are often less healthy and more expensive than home-cooked meals. The system will be trained on a large dataset of recipes and allergen substitutes, with a focus on common meals and allergens. The system will provide appropriate substituents for the respective allergies . Users can find substituents easily & can make the recipes provided in the system .
